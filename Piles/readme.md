# Piles

You have a number of stones with known weights w1, …, wn. Write a program that will rearrange the stones into two piles such that weight difference between the piles is minimal.

**Input**

Input contains the number of stones n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and weights of the stones w1, …, wn (integers, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100) delimited by white spaces.

**Output**

Your program should output a number representing the minimal possible weight difference between stone piles.
